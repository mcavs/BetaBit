## About

Dive into the world of bizarre figures - fractals. Seemingly chaotic but described in a surprisingly orderly way. However, to discover this order, one must know what to look at.

Our journey through the land of fractals consists of three parts. Each part has its own guide, an outstanding Polish mathematician whose results are related to fractals.

The first part is mainly focused on the construction of three simple fractals. Here we will organize some key concepts necessary to understand the succeeding chapters. A brilliant organizer — Wacław Sierpiński – is the guide.

The second part will allow us to delve into the mathematical foundations of fractals. There will be definitions and theorems that math students usually encounter in their first year of study. Who could take better care of this part than the brilliant mathematician Stefan Banach?

The third part is lead by Hugo Steinhaus, who was very interested in applications. So he is a dream guide to interesting applications of fractals.
