    "text": "The Beta Bit project was conceived to help understand the statistical thinking mindset and to increase skills known as data literacy. This can be accomplished in a variety of ways, the approach we prefer here is based on three foundations:\n\nShow the whole process. When working with data, it is very rare to use only one method or one trick. So showing how statistical thinking works should show the entire process of inference so that one can understand the context and the impact of the choices taken along the way from the begining to the final results.\nData analysis is fun. So learning how to do data analysis should be fun to! This can be achieved by using real data and current and interesting problems.\nPlay through these adventures yourself by messing with the data in your favorite software. All results presented should be completely reproducible so that the reader can try for themselves what would have happened if they had made different decisions in the data analysis process."

    "text": "Beta and Bit stories\nThe list of stories will grow. Currently, we invite you to read the following stories.\n\nDo you want to explore the life cycle of a predictive model? How to build a predictive model using decision trees or a random forest and then dig deeper into the model to understand what relationships it has learned? If so, the story ,,The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Responsible Machine Learning with code snippets in Python and R’’ is for you.\nOr maybe you are interested in the arcana of data visualization? Then you should read Charts Runners - a collection of short essays on how to visualize data, how not to do it, how to use ggplot2 package and what visual communication standards you can use.\nThe Chaos Game is for those interested in fractals. The three short stories will introduce both the characters of the three great mathematicians and allow you to learn the mathematical basis of fractals - geometric figures with properties not of this earth. The included codes in R, Python and Julia will allow you to draw fractals yourself in any of these languages."
